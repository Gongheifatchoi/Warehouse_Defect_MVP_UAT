            **Spalling:**
            - **Surface spalling**: Cosmetic, limited depth
            - **Moderate spalling**: Exposed aggregate, some reinforcement visible
            - **Severe spalling**: Significant concrete loss, reinforcement exposed

            - **Active corrosion**: Rust formation and expansion
