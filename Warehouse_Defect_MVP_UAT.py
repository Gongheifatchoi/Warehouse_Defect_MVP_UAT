        DEFECTS IDENTIFIED:
        {defects_info}
        
        Please provide a detailed analysis including:
        
        1. DEFECT-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
           - Precise definition and description of each defect type
           - Engineering significance and severity rating
           - Root cause analysis for each defect type
        
        2. TENANCY TIMELINE ASSESSMENT:
           - **Pre-Tenancy vs During Tenancy Comparison**: 
             * Which defects are likely pre-existing vs tenant-induced?
             * Typical defect progression timelines for each defect type
             * Expected vs accelerated deterioration rates
        
        3. LIABILITY ASSESSMENT:
           - **Landlord vs Tenant Responsibility**: 
             * Defects typically considered landlord responsibility
             * Defects that may be tenant-induced or exacerbated
             * Maintenance obligation boundaries
        
        4. LEGAL AND INSURANCE IMPLICATIONS:
           - Documentation requirements for tenancy disputes
           - Insurance claim considerations
           - Dilapidation schedule implications
        
        5. DEFECT-SPECIFIC MITIGATION WITH TENANCY CONTEXT:
           - Urgency of repairs based on tenancy status
           - Tenant safety considerations
           - Repair scheduling around tenancy arrangements
