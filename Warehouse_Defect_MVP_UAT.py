        Please provide a detailed comparative analysis including:

           - New defects that appeared during tenancy

           - Defects that remained unchanged
           - Defects that improved or were repaired
        
        2. LIABILITY ASSESSMENT:
           - Clear determination of landlord vs tenant responsibility for each defect change
           - Typical timelines for defect development vs tenancy duration
           - Wear and tear vs actual damage assessment
        
        3. QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON:
           - Defect count changes by type
           - Severity progression analysis
           - Rate of deterioration assessment
        
        4. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS:
           - Immediate safety concerns
           - Repair prioritization based on liability
           - Documentation requirements for dispute resolution
           - Preventive measures for future
