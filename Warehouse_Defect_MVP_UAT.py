        As a licensed structural engineer with expertise in concrete pathology and warehouse structural assessment,

        DEFECTS IDENTIFIED:
        {defects_info}
        
        Please provide a comprehensive engineering assessment including:
        
        1. STRUCTURAL SIGNIFICANCE:
           - Rate severity for each defect type (Minor, Moderate, Severe, Critical)
           - Potential impact on structural integrity and load-bearing capacity
           - Risk of progressive deterioration
        
        2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
           - Material deficiencies (concrete mix design, aggregate issues)
           - Construction practices (improper curing, compaction issues)
           - Environmental factors (freeze-thaw cycles, chemical exposure)
           - Loading conditions (overloading, dynamic impacts)
           - Corrosion mechanisms (chloride ingress, carbonation)
        
        3. QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT:
           - Estimated remaining service life reduction
           - Crack width classification per ACI 224R or relevant standards
           - Spalling depth and area significance
           - Reinforcement corrosion activity level
        
        4. MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
           - Immediate safety precautions required
           - Short-term stabilization measures
           - Long-term repair methodologies (epoxy injection, cathodic protection, etc.)
           - Monitoring and inspection frequency recommendations
        
        5. COST AND TIMELINE IMPLICATIONS:
           - Urgency of intervention
           - Estimated repair complexity
           - Potential business interruption impacts
        
        Provide specific, actionable recommendations based on engineering best practices and relevant codes (ACI, EN, AS).
        Use technical terminology appropriate for structural engineering professionals.
