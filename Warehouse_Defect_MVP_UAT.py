    1. Upload photos of different warehouse areas (floors, walls, columns, etc.)

    - **Hairline cracks**: Monitor, typically cosmetic
    - **Medium cracks**: Requires professional assessment
    - **Wide cracks**: Immediate attention needed
    - **Spalling/Corrosion**: Structural assessment recommended
    - **Staining/Efflorescence**: Investigate moisture sources
